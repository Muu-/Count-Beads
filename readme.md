# Beadscount

A simple application used to count number of Hama/Nabbi/Ikea Pyssla beads necessary for recreating an image.

Download it from [my blog page](http://www.lanoiadimuu.it/2015/04/counting-plastic-beads-now-with-a-gui)

Launch the application, click **load** to select your image and click **count** to get a list of colors (Hex format) and how many bead are needed per color.
Note: the counting includes background beads, if the same color is used for both background and front colors, you may want to edit the image in your favorite editor and change background color.

Written in C# and using [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) for multiplatform GUI. Licensed under MIT License.

Should work on both .NET and Mono on all main desktop OSes (Win, OSX, Linux).
